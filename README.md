# odin-recipes
This represents my first project from The Odin Project.

The main focus of the project  is to become familiar with basic HTML syntax. 

The project consists of a main page index.html which contains three relative links (3 deserts)
where the user can find the description, ingridients and steps of the desert.

During this project i learnt how to write HTML code from zero, how to center and space elements,
how to use ordered and unordered lists, different type of headings, images and relative links.

Futhermore i learnt about git and how to upload projects on github.
